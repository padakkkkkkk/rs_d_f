* Key point
* Application
* Reflections
* Reference

In this course, I learned a lot about remote sensing knowledge, especially the use of cloud platforms like GEE, which I have never experienced before. I also mastered the use of Quarto, which is also a very advance experience. But unfortunately I am still not very skilled in the operation of Xaringan.

Thanks to Andy for his teaching, Wenlan and other classmates for their guidance and help.
