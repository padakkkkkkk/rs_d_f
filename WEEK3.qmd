## Key Points

![sensor and image](image/31.webp)

Here shows a basic flow of how remote sensing is used in practice, it includes a few steps from data collection. As there are many factors influencing the RS image acquisition like, sensor characteristics, weather (particularly cloud cover), acquisition method (satellite or airborne) and others, remotely sensed images can contain flaws within them. Therefore, to improve image quality as a basis for further analysis, the most common step is carrying out **corrections**.

### Correction 

To talking about this processing chain we can introduce the product levels. And we will summary some main points about each correction.

![correction and product levels](image/32.png)

**Geometric Correction**

* Causes
    + Curvature of the earth      
    + Topography of the terrain   
    + Earth rotation              
    + View angle (off-nadir)      
    + ...

* Correction Steps

Acquisition of ground control points (GCP) : Use Ground Control Points (GCP) as a reference point for correct location data

Building a Sensor Model: formulate the relation between the current and the reference location data

Coordinate Transformation: Once a suitable sensor model is defined it can be applied to the image raw data to calculate the corrected coordinates of the pixel locations 

Resampling of Pixel Values: The coordinate transformations shifts and rotates the pixel locations. These new locations do not fit into a regular grid of the raster files. Therefore, the pixel values need to be resampled to assign each grid cell one raster values.

# What is a ground control point (GCP)?

Ground Control Points (GCPs) are defined as points on the surface of the earth of known location used to geo-reference Landsat Level-1 data. GCPs are updated as needed to continually improve Landsat data. GCPs can be [downloaded](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/ground-control-points) and used as reference data.

*  Examining the Accuracy

Root mean squared error can be used to measure the difference between locations that are known and locations that have been interpolated or digitized or resampled.
\begin{equation}
RMS_{error}=\sqrt{(X^{'}-X_{orig}+Y^{'}-Y_{orig})^2}
\end{equation}

**Atmospheric Correction**

removes the scattering and absorption effects from the atmosphere to obtain the surface reflectance characterizing (surface properties)

* Causes
    + Atmospheric scattering 
    + Atmospheric reflections
    + Topographic attenuation   
    + ...

* Correction Methods

Methods can be divided into 2 types according to the results of the correction

Relative atmospheric correction method: for example the dark object subtraction (DOS), histogram adjustment and psuedo-invariant features (PIFs)

Absolute atmospheric correction method: there are some transfer models or codes such as MODTRAN 4+ and 6S can be used to deal with scattering and absorption, this is called model-based atmospheric correction methods. We can also use the empirical line correction by take measurements in site using a field spectrometer.

* Topographic Correction
