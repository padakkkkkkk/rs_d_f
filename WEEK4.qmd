The learning diary of this week is about policies in cities, and how we can use RS technology to achieve the goals/ideas behind the policy.

Here is an example in Pau da Lima, City of Salvador, Brazil

## Policy

In this case study, the [NEW!! World Cities Report 2022](https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2022/06/wcr_2022.pdf) is the intact referring policy. And the **Chapter 10: Building Resilience for Sustainable Urban Futures** (Page.334) is the section particularly been focused on. There are some of the Policy points mentioned in this part:

> * Investing in key urban infrastructure must be a prerequisite for building sustainable and resilient urban futures.
* Policymakers must match urban risk assessments with appropriate solutions
* Visioning and implementation of urban resilience plans must prioritize the poorest and most vulnerable communities.
* Building urban resilience will not succeed without public participation.

So the infrastructure, urban risk, communities in disadvantage are highlighted here. It reminds us the vulnerability of slums and informal settlements due to the poor infrastructure is far from Resilience.

Following the report, in **10.4. Environmental Resilience**, it talks about raising awareness of different local urban risks and identification of feasible disaster prevention and preparedness. In which the discussion of flood is involved: 

>...focused principally on flood risk, with imaginative awareness raising strategies and mitigation strategies including a shift from traditional hard engineering solutions towards naturebased solutions and ecosystem services such as restoring and expanding riverine vegetation and floodplains...

And next, the report emphasizes on building resilience in slums and informal settlements, this is because people and areas there are facing particular vulnerabilities and high risks.

Therefore, referring the policy, this case study tried to pay attention to building **resilience in slums and informal settlements**. Focused principally on **flood risk**. The policy suggests that we could achieve the development of resilience cities with:

>...imaginative awareness-raising strategies and mitigation strategies including a shift from traditional hard engineering solutions towards nature-based solutions and ecosystem services...

That is quite abstract. However, as RS technology is closely related to the nature, and can be used in both hard engineering and software system, I think we can achieve it. 

## Study Area and the Problem Desription

(Slum community) Pau da Lima, City of Salvador, Brazil

![Pau da Lima](image/4slum.jpeg)

In total, 67% of the population of Salvador and 37% of the urban population in Brazil reside in slum communities with equal or greater levels of poverty as that found in Pau da Lima. And a tropical rainforest country, the average monthly precipitation is more than 60 mm, which shows that the area has a large amount of precipitation all year round. However, the area's **drainage system is unstable and has open sewers**, so overflows often occur during periods of heavy rain, and the valley floor is prone to flooding. **Sanitary conditions in the area are generally poor, and residents are often exposed to garbage and sewers**. Besides, **the buildings in slum areas are informal, so their structure is often unstable which will cause danger in storm rain periods**.

## Proposed Measures

### Assessment

|Name|Notes|Aims|Data and Methods|
|-------|----------------------|---------|----------------|
| Land-use and Land-cover recognition| The complex distribution of buildings in slum areas and the lack of a clear building plan make it difficult to map the areas. Furthermore, the Pau da Lim slum is in a valley area and is heavily vegetated, which makes it more difficult to classify land use|Identify the distribution of settlements, reservoirs, sewers, etc. in slums| Using multispectral or hyperspectral imagery, combined with image recognition and machine learning algorithm techniques; Using SAR for texture analysis to identify residential buildings|
|Terrain detection|For houses in low-lying areas and in flood-prone areas, the risk factor is higher in flooding|Assessment of the hazard index at the terrain level|Using LIDAR technology to obtain topographic elevations and generate DEM data|
|Physical safety of buildings measurement|Many buildings in slum areas are not built to code and have unstable roofs, which can easily fall off during heavy rainfall and cause injuries|Detection of dangerous buildings|Using VHR images to extract physical, geometric features of buildings|
|Environmental Assessment|Poor hygiene around the house, such as sewage running through or open piles of rubbish, can cause serious health problems when flooding|Analysis of the environmental health of the surroundings of the residence|Monitoring of water quality parameters (e.g. water temperature, cyanobacteria concentration, chlorophyll concentration, etc.) in water bodies using meteorological satellites for effluent identification|

: Targets and Methods for Flood Risk Assessment

### Reconstruction

Referring to the results of the assessment, dangerous houses are rebuilt and houses in flood-prone areas unsuitable for building houses are relocated. In addition, the layout of sewerage pipes can be adapted to the land use situation, etc.

### Monitoring

|Name|Aims|Data and Methods|
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
|Precipitation monitoring|Real-time monitoring of the relationship between soil moisture content and rainfall in the area to predict the occurrence of flooding|Using the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) on MetOp for soil moisture observations, combined with the SM2RAIN-ASCAT global-scale rainfall product dataset for flooding predictions|
|Real-time detection of flooding disasters|Identification of the area currently affected by flooding|Using Landsat5TM data and the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) for the extraction of water bodies. If the weather is bad, SAR can also be used too|
|Disaster assessment| |Comparing remote sensing images before and after flooding|
|Land use change analysis|Analysis of the expansion of the study area and adjustment of the drainage system to the changes in land use|Like the data and methods of Land-use and Land-cover recognition|
